## Speech Synthesis App

Recreated the Voiceinator 5000, a popular Javascript30 app, originally developed by Wes Bos. This app utilizes the Web Speech API that is built into the browser. Furthermore it utilizes the SpeechSynthesis Interface, a text-to-speech component that allows programs to voice out text content.
